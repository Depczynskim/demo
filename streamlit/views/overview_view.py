        This dashboard provides a live look into the marketing and sales performance for an e-commerce store. 
        It automatically gathers data from Google Analytics, Google Ads, and Search Console to present a 
        unified view of what's working and where there are opportunities to grow.

        ### About the Project
        This is a personal project built with Python and Streamlit, designed to provide valuable, easy-to-understand 
        insights for a small business. The AI features use the OpenAI API to generate helpful reports. All data is anonymized.

        ### Future Development
        I'm currently focused on enhancing the AI capabilities to provide more predictive insights, such as identifying 
        high-value user segments and offering specific recommendations to improve marketing ROI. The goal is to 
        evolve this from a reporting tool into a proactive decision-making assistant.
